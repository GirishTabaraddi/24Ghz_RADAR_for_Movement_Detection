# 24Ghz_RADAR_for_Movement_Detection

This Project describes the Movement Detection using 24GHz CW-RADAR sensor which was performed in the System Driven Hardware Design Lab as a lab group.

KiCad_LabProject - This folder contains all the schematic and pcb files.
				 - 10_work folder contains the recent files of the project schematic.
				 - 20_release folder contains all the previous versions of the circuit design.

SDHD_PSoC_Codes - This folder contains all the project codes for various lab assigments and final code of the movement detector Project

SDHD_Lab3_FFT.cydsn - This workspace inside the SDHD_PSoC_Codes is the main code required for executing the Movement Detection.

Project Report pdf and ppt are added for reference to understand how the project was performed in the lab during summer semester.

This Project was carried at Hochschule Darmstadt during Summer semester 2023.
